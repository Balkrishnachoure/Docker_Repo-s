Architecture : 
Api Server : It validate and configure data for pods ,services, replicationControllers etc through etcd .
etcd : It is a distributed key-value store that manage the configuration data ,state data and metadata for 
        kubernetes .
Controller-Manager : It monitor the current state of your cluster through Api server and make appropriate changes
          to keep the application running by ensuring that pods are in healthy state .
Schedular :It assign the pods to the Nodes .It determine which Node is suitable for each pod according to constraints 
          and available resources .
Kublet : It is a node-agent and is responsible to manage the life cycle of Containers .It comunicates with the
         Api server to ensure that containers are running as intended and report back any issues that occur .

Service Object : We know that pods in kubernates can be terminated at any time and hence we cant rely on their IP 
        as they can change at any time .Henc service bjec came in picture .It provide stable IP address to connect
        Pods and aslo redirect the traffic to the pods .

Kube-proxy : It is a network proxy that runs on each node in Kubernetes-cluster .It is installed on every node in 
             the cluster and monitor the changes happen to service object and their endpoints .Ii then translate these 
             changes to actual network rules .
