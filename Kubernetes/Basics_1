What is Kubernates ? 
It is a popural Container Orchestration tool .Similar to Docker Swarm(it is also an Orchestration tool) .

UseCases : 
1.In orchestration tool we have Kubernatese Cluster . This cluster contains the multiple containers and monitor the
health of servcies .If the container in not in healthy state the it will destroy the container and create the new 
one and up and run the services .In this way the management of service become eas with the help of Kbenatese .

2.Kubernatese also helps in Blue green deployment means upate the version on service with zero downtime .

3.Autoscaling : It means if the traffic is increased the nodes will automatically get added .

Basic Terminologies : 
1 POD : It is a collection of one or more containers and th smalest unit of Kubernates application .Ip address is 
        assigned to the Pod .It can also contains the volumes .
2.Replicate Set (RS): It is a Kubernatese object that ensures there is always stable set set of running pods for 
                for specific workload .
3.Name Space : Way to organise the Clusters into virtual SubClusters .Eg: Seperating the clusters for Dev, UAT , Development .

4. Kurenates Service : Used to redirects the traffic or port mapping .The idea of the service is to group the 
             set of pod endpoints into a single resource .
