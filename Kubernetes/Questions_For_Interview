==============================================
Answers : 
Ans 1 .   kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never 
          kbectl delete pods --all 
          kubectl explain pod  or  kubectl explain pod --recursive(much better) 

Ans 2 .Kubernetes has a client-server architecture, where interactions between the Kubernetes client (such as kubectl) and the server (the Kubernetes control plane, including the API server) can be described as client-side and server-side processes.
Ans 3 .
Ans 4 . kubectl apply -f <file-name>.yaml . or kubectl apply -f <file-name.yaml> --server-dry-run
        kubectl get pods <pod-name> -o wide  -> To get basic info .
        kubectl describe pod <pod-name>   -> To get detailed info .

Ans 6. 
1.If the pod is part of a deployment, you can edit the deployment, and Kubernetes will roll out the changes to the pods managed by that deployment.
 
 # Command : kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>

2.For minor changes like updating labels or annotations, you can use the kubectl patch command.

 # Command : kubectl patch pod <pod-name> -p '{"metadata": {"labels": {"new-label": "value"}}}' 


Ans 7.  Both kubectl create and kubectl apply are used to execute YAML files and manage resources, but they behave differently based on the use case.

1. kubectl create :

   ->Purpose: Creates a resource in Kubernetes from the specified YAML file if it does not already exist.
   ->Behavior:Creates the resource for the first time.
              If the resource already exists, it throws an error indicating that the resource already exists.
              Cannot be used for updating an existing resource.
              It is imperative command .

2.kubectl apply :
 ->Purpose: Creates or updates a resource by applying changes described in the YAML file.
 ->Behavior:If the resource does not exist, it creates the resource.
          If the resource already exists, it updates the resource based on the differences between the live 
          and desired state.
  ->Declarative management: kubectl apply is used for declarative configuration .

Use case: Updating deployments, config maps, etc. where you may want to modify or apply changes to an 
         existing resource .

Ans 8 . Significance of Environment Variables in Kubernetes Pods : 

1.Decoupling Configuration from Code:
Environment variables make it easy to configure an application without changing the code. You can use the same container image across different environments (development, testing, production) by simply changing the environment variables.

2. Flexibility and Reusability:
Containers can be reused across different environments or clusters by dynamically setting configuration through environment variables.

 ### Example Use Case:
If you have a web application container that connects to a database, you might define environment variables like DB_HOST, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD. These variables allow the application to point to different databases in different environments (e.g., dev, prod) without changing the application code:
.yml file 
---------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: webapp-container
      image: my-webapp-image
      env:
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: "db.mycompany.com"
        - name: DB_USER
          value: "user1"
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-password-secret
              key: password
---------------

Ans 9 . # Command : kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash -> To execute any command in pod 
        # Command : docker exec <container-name> <command>


Ans 10 .
