Both the Dockerfile and Docker-compose serve different purpose and have Difference Functionality .

1. Docker file : It is the text file that contains instructions for building Image .
                  It starts with 'FROM' specifying base image followed by instructions like 'RUN', 'COPY','EXPOSE','CMD' .

             2.It is also used to define Environmet  and dependencies required by and application and also specify how 
               the application should be configured in Container .

             3.Docker file is mainly used for building single-container docker images.


2. Docker-Compose : It is used for running multi-container Docker applications .
                     In docker-compose.yml we define services ,networks and volumes to make up the application .
                     It simpfy the management of mulit-container application , as we cas easily spin up the environment
                      with single command .


Note : In summary, while Dockerfile is used to define the build steps for a single Docker image, 
       Docker Compose is used to define and manage multi-container applications.
